# A list of useful pilot training resources to get you started

## "Tim Loves Bacon" (TSA, IACRA, Medical followed by 61.87(b). 61.87(c)  61.87(n))

If you are a US citizen you will need to bring in your passport and get a one time ยง 1552.3 Flight training endorsment
(61.65h A.14)

If you are not a US citizen you must register for an account and get fingerprinted through https://www.fts.tsa.dhs.gov/home :
<a href="https://www.fts.tsa.dhs.gov/home" target="_blank">TSA FTSP Flight Training Security Program</a>

You will need to set up an account with IACRA AND submit an application for a student pilot licesne. Many an aspiring pilot who has set up the account has failed to submit the application. It is a 2+ step procedure. Please put your FTN number along with your login details in your phone. You will need these along the way and they are usually required under pressure so knowing where they are will prove invaluable.  https://iacra.faa.gov/ :

Youtube has this one which walks you through the steps:

You will need to visit an Aviation Medical Examiner and procure a 3rd class medical. You may choose any AME you like. For simplicity I recomend:
Samir Shahin, MD
8930 S. SEPULVEDA BLVD SUITE 200
Los Angeles, California 90045
Voice: (310) 641-8111

(He is known to occaisionlly ask if you want a second class medical at no aditional charge. Please say "yes!" It means you are healthy.)


# The mandatory reading.

Your pilot training is based on the following two reading materials compiled by the FAA. There are may ways to approach them. The important part is that you approach them. find what interest you and proceed from there.

<a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak" target="_blank">PHAK = Pilots Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge</a>

<a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook" target="_blank">AFH = Airplane Flying Handbook</a>

## If the FAA Books are the eggs, milk, flour and water; The online ground school is the delicious pancakes.

Having gone through Gleim and Kings Schools while doing my own PPL, and later having discovered Sporty's and Pilot Institute, I highly recomend Sporty's at this time. You are of course free to choose any online ground school you like. <a href="https://www.sportys.com/learn-to-fly/private-pilot-learn-to-fly-course.html" target="_blank">Sporty's Learn To Fly</a>  :https://www.sportys.com/learn-to-fly/private-pilot-learn-to-fly-course.html

Do I need an online ground school? 
Short answer - Yes!

Long answer - You are certainly invited to pay me by the hour at $110. I will spoon feed you the information you need as my schedule permits, then we will fly the airplane on the rare occaision when we are not going over the ground material. Most likely you will get frustrated after a few months and simply stop showing up. In the unlikely event that we keep this up you will complete your training as a pilot that flies remarkably like I do in 6 or 7 years time. Alternatively you can do an online ground school as your time permits. When you have questions or want to go deeper on a subject you can dig into it in the FAA books. All this will cost you a one time fee of $299 and be yours for the rest of your life. As long as I see you are progressing I will answer texts and phone calls free of charge.

# What happens next?

We get you ready for you to kick me out of the airplane and fly by yourself as a student solo. This happens when you meet the requirements set forth in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-C/section-61.87" target="_blank">CFR 61.87(d)</a>

(1) Proper flight preparation procedures, including preflight planning and preparation, powerplant operation, and aircraft systems; 

(2) Taxiing or surface operations, including runups; 

(3) Takeoffs and landings, including normal and crosswind; 

(4) Straight and level flight, and turns in both directions; 

(5) Climbs and climbing turns; 

(6) Airport traffic patterns, including entry and departure procedures; 

(7) Collision avoidance, windshear avoidance, and wake turbulence avoidance; 

(8) Descents, with and without turns, using high and low drag configurations; 

(9) Flight at various airspeeds from cruise to slow flight; 

(10) Stall entries from various flight attitudes and power combinations with recovery initiated at the first indication of a stall, and recovery from a full stall; 

(11) Emergency procedures and equipment malfunctions; 

(12) Ground reference maneuvers; 

(13) Approaches to a landing area with simulated engine malfunctions; 

(14) Slips to a landing; and 

(15) Go-arounds.

How long does this take? Well that is entirely dependent on you. If I have to drag you through it, about three months. If you come in and say "I am ready to challenge sixty one dot eighty seven delta three through seven today" a lot less than a month. 

How often should I be training? 2 to 3 times a week. Any less and you will have to re-learn what you already acquired every time you come in. More is certainly appreciated, though it is beneficial to sleep on it and alow your brain to make the neccessary connections while you dream of flying. This is a good indicator that you are learning. In the begining you will saturate after about an hour of flight. as you progress, you will get more out of longer flights.


# Things I will ask you for and / or that will help you along the way.

The FAA likes to offer awesome aviation things for free. One of those things is the "Wings" Program. You will need to set up another account here. 
<a href="https://www.faasafety.gov/" target="_blank">Wings program</a> : https://www.faasafety.gov/

I will be asking for completion certificates on:

ALC-481, ALC-322, ALC-42, ALC-480 (optional)

After you Solo I will be asking for:

ALC-449, ALC-62, ALC-653

If you find any that you are particularly keen on that I've missed, please do let me know and I will add them here.


# Awesome links I've found along the way

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lippisch" target="_blank">Alexander Martin Lippisch</a> was a German aeronautical engineer, a pioneer of aerodynamics who made important contributions to the understanding of tailless aircraft, delta wings and the ground effect. While at the University of Iowa he made the most amazing series of videos showing the science of flight. To explain this statement, I'm all for an artists interpretation of a scientific phenomenon, it helps get a three dimensional understanding of difficult concepts, but it will always be just that. An interpretation of the effect. Lippisch on the other hand "demonstrated the science". : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwr4eb5N5Dr6qqVuHy__GMl9ORfcA9YP1" target="_blank">The Secret of Flight by University of Iowa</a>
