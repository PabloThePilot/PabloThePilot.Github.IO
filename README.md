# The mandatory reading.

Your pilot training is based on the following two reading materials compiled by the FAA. There are may ways to approach them. The important part is that you approach them. find what interest you and proceed from there.

## If the FAA Books are the Eggs, Milk, Flour and water; The online ground school is the delicious pancakes.

Having gone through Gleim and Kings Schools while doing my own PPL, and later having descovered Sporty's and Pilot Institute, I highly recomend Spoprty's at this time. You are of course free to choose any online ground school you like. https://www.sportys.com/learn-to-fly/private-pilot-learn-to-fly-course.html :

Do I need an online ground school. Short answer - Yes!
Long answer - You are certainly invited to pay me by the hour at $110. I will spoon feed you the information you need as my schedule permits, then we will fly the airplane on the rare ocaision that we we are not going over the ground material. Most likely you will get frustrated after a few months and simply stop showing up. In the unlikely event that we keep this up you will graduate a student pilot that flies remarkably like I do in 6 or 7 years time. Alternatively you can do an online ground school as time permits. when you have questions or want to go deeper on a subject you can dig into it in the FAA books. All this will cost you a one time fee of $299 and be yours for the rest of your life. You might even be able to share it with your children and family should they become interested in flying.
