If you are a US citizen you will need to bring in your passport and get a one time ยง 1552.3 Flight training endorsment
(61.65h A.14)

If you are not a US citizen you must register for an account and get fingerprinted through https://www.fts.tsa.dhs.gov/home :

You will need to set up an account with IACRA AND submit an application for a student pilot licesne. Many an aspiring pilot who has set up the account has failed to submit the application. It is a 2+ step procedure. https://iacra.faa.gov/ :

Youtube has this one which walks you through the steps:

You will need to visit an Aviation Medical Examiner and procure a 3rd class medical. You may choose any AME you like. For simplicity I recomend:
Samir Shahin, MD
8930 S. SEPULVEDA BLVD SUITE 200
Los Angeles, California 90045
Voice: (310) 641-8111

(He is known to occaisionlly ask if you want a second class medical at no aditional charge. Please say "yes!" It means you are healthy.)


# The mandatory reading.

Your pilot training is based on the following two reading materials compiled by the FAA. There are may ways to approach them. The important part is that you approach them. find what interest you and proceed from there.

<a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak" target="_blank">PHAK = Pilots Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge</a>

## If the FAA Books are the eggs, milk, flour and water; The online ground school is the delicious pancakes.

Having gone through Gleim and Kings Schools while doing my own PPL, and later having discovered Sporty's and Pilot Institute, I highly recomend Spoprty's at this time. You are of course free to choose any online ground school you like. https://www.sportys.com/learn-to-fly/private-pilot-learn-to-fly-course.html :

Do I need an online ground school? Short answer - Yes!
Long answer - You are certainly invited to pay me by the hour at $110. I will spoon feed you the information you need as my schedule permits, then we will fly the airplane on the rare occaision when we are not going over the ground material. Most likely you will get frustrated after a few months and simply stop showing up. In the unlikely event that we keep this up you will complete your training as a pilot that flies remarkably like I do in 6 or 7 years time. Alternatively you can do an online ground school as your time permits. When you have questions or want to go deeper on a subject you can dig into it in the FAA books. All this will cost you a one time fee of $299 and be yours for the rest of your life. As long as I see you are progressing I will answer texts and phone calls free of charge.
